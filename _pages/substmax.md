title: "Amino Acid Substituion Matrices"
---


<p>
Sequence alignment is a standard method to infer evolutionary,
structural, and functional relationships among proteins. The quality
of alignments depends on the substitution matrix used. We derive
matrices based on superimpositions from protein pairs of similar
structure, but of low or no sequence similarity. In a performance test
the matrices are compared to 12 other previously published
matrices. It is found that the structure derived matrices are
applicable for comparisons of distantly related sequences. We
investigate the influence of evolutionary relationships of protein
pairs on the alignment accuracy.
