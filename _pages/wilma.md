<p>
  <li>WILMA was an automated platform for the functional annotation and data mining on
    large sets of protein sequences.
      </li>

  <li>Different methods and databases for protein sequence and
    structure bioinformatics are integrated in order to identify and
      describe the functional domains of proteins.
        </li>



 <li>Access to the annotations is provided via a web-interface and
  a database API.</li>


 <li>WILMA was applied to annotate Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Arabidopsis
  thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans and several bacterial organisms.
   </li>

 <li> Responsible for integration of methods and data into relational
  database, database design and administration, web interface.
   </li>

 <li>Consultant for a startup called *ProCeryon* and application of WILMA in collaborations with costumers</li>
